I am a Research Intern at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in the Department of Electrical  Engineering under the supervision of Professor Pascal Frossard.

Before joining EPFL, I was a research intern at the Imperial College of London under the supervision of Professor Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi Dezfooli. I received my bachelor's in Computer and Communication Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Hamid Sheikhzadeh and Prof. Vahid Pourahmadi at the <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Tehran Polytechnic</a>. My  research focused on the analysis of the robustness of classifiers and the theoretical guarantees of foundation models.
